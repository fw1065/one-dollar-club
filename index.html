<h1>Introducing "The $1 Club"</h1>

<h3>Idea:</h3> 
<p>Concept of Kaizen - to make small improvements everyday, step by step. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)</p>

<h3>For who:</h3> 
<p>Students for students.</p>

<h3>The rules:</h3>

<ol>
<li>This is an informal gathering where anyone can become speakers.</li>

<li>A coin box will be placed at the door. Drop $1 as a token of entry and you can enter and listen to a talk given by an 
ADM student. (The price is set to be affordable to all students, but it cannot be free because there is no 
free lunch in this world.)</li>

<li>The money collected in the coin box will be given to the speaker 100%. 
(The money is to reward the speaker for his/her effort.)</li>

<li>Everyone is welcome to sit in and listen.</li>

<li>There will only be one speaker per session.</li>

<li>Speaker can share anything about him/herself. (Any topics useful for students. No politics.)</li>

<li>Simple sharing of knowledge will do. (You don't have to be a highly skilled professional to share what you know, 
it can be very simple. Just share what you know. The power of this comes from repetitions 
and repetitions and discussions in every following sessions.)</li>

<li>Each speaker is only given one hour. (Start on time and end on time. No extra time.)</li>

<li>Anyone from the audience can choose or choose not to pose questions to the speaker.</li>

<li>The ultimate idea is to learning something useful from different people.</li>
