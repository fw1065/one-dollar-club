One dollar movement

An informal learning club to promote sharing of knowledge and ideas.

Name: "The $1 Club"

Idea: To make small improvements everyday, step by step.

The rules:

1. This is an informal gathering where anyone can become speakers.

2. A coin box will be placed at the door. Drop $1 as a token of entry and you can enter and listen to a talk given the speaker. (The price is set to be affordable to all, but it cannot be free because there is no free lunch in this world.)

3. The money collected in the coin box will be given to the speaker 100%. (The money is to reward the speaker for his/her effort.)

4. Everyone is welcome to sit in and listen.

5. There will only be one speaker per session.

6. Speaker can share anything about him/herself. (Any topics useful for students. No politics.)

7. Simple sharing of knowledge will do. (You don't have to be a highly skilled professional to share what you know, it can be very simple. Just share what you know. The power of this comes from repetitions and repetitions and discussions in every following sessions.)

8. Each speaker is only given one hour. (Start on time and end on time. No extra time.)

9. Anyone from the audience can choose or choose not to pose questions to the speaker.

10. The ultimate idea is to learning something useful from different people.

Some example topics:

Sharing of projects: showcase recent school works, personal works, mini projects, outside projects
Startup ideas: web 2.0 ideas, ideas for new apps & emerging technology.
Technology: google maps, html and css, javascript
Art: how to draw, how to do printmaking, art critics, art scene
Design tips: favorite photoshop tricks, favourite fonts, recommended printers in singapore
Web tips: how to setup wordpress, how to buy domain name and web hosting, how to build an online portfolio, seo rankings, web fonts etc.
Life experiences: travel stories, asia, south east asia.
Initiatives: Saving bukit brown, any art history project initiatives.
